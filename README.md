iChrome
=======

iChrome is a highly customizable, iGoogle homepage replacement extension influenced by Google Now. It includes 26 HD themes, 19 widgets, multiple tabs, "OK Google" hotword detection and voice search and full customization.

This is the Github repository for it, main development does __not__ happen here, it's simply up so you can view the source code and maybe build/suggest widgets or features.

I expect to update this repository with extension updates as they're released to the public.  I haven't had time to clean up the code so certain things are rather messy.
