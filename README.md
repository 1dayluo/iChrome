# iChrome

iChrome is a highly customizable, iGoogle homepage replacement extension influenced by Google Now. It includes almost 100 HD themes, over 30 widgets, support for multiple tabs, "OK Google" hotword detection and voice search and almost complete customization.

This is the full source for iChrome except for API secrets which have been replaced with empty strings (`""`).

The code's somewhat messy, but I'm thinking of restructuring it using Backbone in V2.1.1 or V2.1.2.  I'm also looking to add internationalization in V2.1.2, so if you'd like to translate it to a specific language please let me know.

## Roadmap

#### V2.1.1
 - This will probably be a bugfix release

#### V2.1.2
 - Code cleanup and restructuring, most likely using Backbone.js

#### V2.1.3
 - Internationalization with support for (at least): Russian, German, Ukrainian, French, Spanish, Chinese and Portuguese 

#### V2.1.x
 - A real website

### V2.2
 - A widgets store that other developers can contribute to
 - iChrome Pro:
   - Shareable tabs
   - Unlimited custom themes
   - Unlimited syncing on iChrome servers
   - Prioritized support and suggestions
   - The ability to create unlimited custom dynamic themes (slideshows, time and date dependent) that are hosted on iChrome servers
   - More, I'm still thinking it through
